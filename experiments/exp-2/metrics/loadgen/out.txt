Make sure that you've specified the right path to the file. If you're running k6 using the Docker image make sure you have mounted the local directory (-v /local/path/:/inside/docker/path) containing your script and modules so that they're accessible by k6 from inside of the container, see https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/modules/#using-local-modules-with-docker."
